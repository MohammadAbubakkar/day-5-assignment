                    HTML stands for HyperText Markup 

                    Language. It is used to design 

                    web pages using a markup language.

                    HTML is the combination of Hypertext

                    and Markup language. Hypertext 

                    defines the link between the web 

                    pages. A markup language is used 

                    to define the text document within 

                    tag which defines the structure of 

                    web pages. HTML is a markup language

                    that is used by the browser to 

                    manipulate text, images, and other

                    content to display it in the required 

                    format.

                    C is a procedural programming language.

                    It was initially developed by Dennis 

                    Ritchie as a system programming 

                    language to write operating system. 

                    The main features of C language include

                    low-level access to memory, simple set 

                    of keywords, and clean style, these 

                    features make C language suitable for

                    system programming like operating system 

                    or compiler development.

                Java has been one of the most 

                popular programming language 

                for many years. Java is Object 

                Oriented. However it is not 

                considered as pure object oriented

                as it provides support for primitive

                data types (like int, char, etc) The

                Java codes are first compiled into byte

                code (machine independent code). Then

                the byte code is run on Java Virtual

                Machine (JVM) regardless of the

                underlying architecture.

 <p> Community is another fundamental concept used in sociology. Because human civilization grows and develop in the lap of community. It is a well known fact that an individual rarely exists alone. He always lives with his fellows in a group. It is also equally true that one can’t be a member of all groups existing in the world. Hence an individual lives and establishes relations with those people who reside in a close proximity with him i.e. within definite territory.</p>
 
 
 <p>
However, the term community has been derived from two Latin words ‘Com’ and ‘Munis’ which means ‘together’ and ‘servicing’ respectively. It consists of a group of people with common and shared interests. But in common discourses the term community very often wrongly used such as racial community, caste community, religious community etc.</p>

<p>Here the meaning of the term community differs from the one which is used in sociology. The term is also used both in a narrower and broader sense. In a narrow sense community refers to Hindu or Muslim community but in a broader sense community may refers to a nation or world community. It also refers to a village, a town or a tribal community.</p>

<p>
When a group of individual or members of any group small or large live together and share a common life and have developed a strong sense of awe feeling among them they form a community. They enter into definite social, economic and cultural relations and have developed a sense of community consciousness which distinguishes them from others. A group of individuals or group of families living in Physical Proximity with each other in a definite geographical boundary constitutes a community.</p>

<p>But to understand the meaning of the term community we must have to give a look towards the definitions given by sociologists. But sociologists differ among themselves in their approach to the meaning of community. Some puts emphasis on area or ecological aspects where as others puts emphasis on psychological aspects.</p>



 <pre>
(1) According to Maclver, “Community is an area of social living marked by some degree of social coherence”.

(2) According to Kingsley Davis, “Community is the smallest territorial group that can embrace all aspects of social life”.

(3) According to Ogburn and Nimkoff, “Community is the total organisation of social life within a limited area”.

(4) According to Arnold Green, “A Community is cluster of people, living within a contiguous small area, who share a common way of life”

(5) According to E.S. Bogardus, “Community is a social group with some degree of’we-feeling’ and living in a given area.”

(6) According to G.A. Lundberg, “Community is a human population living within a limited geographic area and carrying on a common inter-dependent life”.
