                    HTML stands for HyperText Markup 

                    Language. It is used to design 

                    web pages using a markup language.

                    HTML is the combination of Hypertext

                    and Markup language. Hypertext 

                    defines the link between the web 

                    pages. A markup language is used 

                    to define the text document within 

                    tag which defines the structure of 

                    web pages. HTML is a markup language

                    that is used by the browser to 

                    manipulate text, images, and other

                    content to display it in the required 

                    format.

                    C is a procedural programming language.

                    It was initially developed by Dennis 

                    Ritchie as a system programming 

                    language to write operating system. 

                    The main features of C language include

                    low-level access to memory, simple set 

                    of keywords, and clean style, these 

                    features make C language suitable for

                    system programming like operating system 

                    or compiler development.

                Java has been one of the most 

                popular programming language 

                for many years. Java is Object 

                Oriented. However it is not 

                considered as pure object oriented

                as it provides support for primitive

                data types (like int, char, etc) The

                Java codes are first compiled into byte

                code (machine independent code). Then

                the byte code is run on Java Virtual

                Machine (JVM) regardless of the

                underlying architecture.
